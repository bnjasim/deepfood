# deepfood
Classify images of food items using Deep Learning (CNN)

## Simple Non Deep learning based approaches
- Color histograms: code: histogram.py
- Bag of Words: code: siftsvm.py

## Deep learning based methods
- Custom cnn model: custom.py
- Vgg16 pretraining: bottleneck.py


## How to Run?
Code is in python. So run using python filename.py
Note that we use keras library for our CNN training and sklearn for non deep learning methods
